        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Chanjirawan Yongyean,and I'm a third-year Digital Media Engineering student at Khonkaen University.
               I have a passion for web development,artificial intelligence,and creating innovative solutions to real-world problems.
               Throughout my academic journey,I've been fascinated by how technology can improve people's lives and make complex tasks simpler.</p>

            <p>I chose Digital Media Engineering because I love the combination of hardware and software development.
                My goal is to become a full-stack developer and eventually start my own tech company focused on educational technology solutions for rural communities in Thailand.</p>

        <h3>Learning Programming: Challenges and Solutions</h3>
            <p>January 15,2025</p>
            <p>Programming has been one of the most rewarding yet challenging aspects of my computer engineering studies.
                When I first started with Python in my freshman year, I struggled with concepts like loops, functions, and object-oriented programming.
                The syntax seemed overwhelming, and I often felt lost when trying to solve complex problems.</p>

            <p>What helped me improve was consistent practice and breaking down problems into smaller, manageable pieces. I started solving simple programming challenges 
                on platforms like HackerRank and gradually worked my way up to more complex algorithms. I also found that explaining my code to classmates helped me understand concepts better.</p>
                
            <p>Now, as I work with web technologies like JavaScript, I can see how the fundamental programming concepts I learned with Python apply across different languages. The key is to be patient with 
                yourself and celebrate small victories along the way.</p>
